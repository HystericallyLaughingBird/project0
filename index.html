	    	<h2>What is this site all about?</h2>
	    	<p>This website was created as part of a project for an online course</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>It is not well designed becuase that was not the focus here.</li>
	    		<li>As of now, the focus is to complete the project requirements and to practice some basic techniques</li>
	    		<li>That being said, I have taken this oppurtunity to include meaningful content on this site.</li>
	    		<li>The gif is from the comic "Peanuts". I think it's funny.</li>
	    		<li>The pages Jumbo, Grid and SCSS are for meeting project requirements and as such may seem random to you, but they do serve a purpose.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<h2>Some Lessons</h2>
	    	<p>Buidling this site taught me a few things:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>The importance of managing expectations.</li>
	    		<li>The amount of effort and tracking required to make something even as simple and plain a website as this.</li>
	    		<li>An appreciation for all kinds of tasks, coding, design and content creation; writing. That having workflows is important. That certain precautionary measures can simplify work later on, such as typing content in a word processor since (at least this) code editor does not have spell check.</li>
	    		<li>It highlighted the gaps in my learning and also how subconcsious biases can set me up for disapointment.</li>
	    		<li>In any case, this is the first website that I have created that is somewhat meaningful and worth sharing. It is also the first I have hosted on the internet (via github pages). I hope to continuously improve on this work in this future.</li>
