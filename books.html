            <p>Here's a list of a few books that are currently on my table, waiting to be read:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    "50 Psychology Ideas you really need to know" by Adrian Furnham.
                    <p>This book, like the next, is part of a series of books that introduces 50 ideas in a given field. The chapters are only 4 pages long each and as such, the book serves to give you taste of the given, and not much depth. Psychology is an area that interests me and so that's why this book is on my list.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "50 Economic Ideas you really need to know" by Edmund Conway.
                    <p>Economics is another area that interests me and I hope that this book will give me an insight to the various concepts that comprise the economy, some chapters I look forward to reading include: The Malthusian Trap, Capitalism, Communism, Micro and Macro, Gross Domestic Product, Central Banks and Interest rates, Energy and oil, Bond Markets, and many more. The entire book actually, more or less. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Psychology for Dummies" by Adam Cash.
                    <p>This book goes into slighly more detail (from what I can tell having read a small portion over a year ago) and spans a larger number of topics than the first entry on this list.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "12 Rules for life" by Jordan Peterson.
                    <p>Jordan Peterson has had a fair bit of influence on me and this is a book I look forward to reading and adopting the lessons that it teaches. Peterson is a Psychology professor at the Univeristy of Toronto and a practicing psychologist. He has, however become rather (in)famous in the past two years or so due to certain politcal stances he has taken.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    "The One World Schoolhouse" by Salman Khan
                    <p>The fact that I am able to learn web development sitting in my bedroom is a result of the MOOC revolution. Salman Khan (not the actor) though was using technology to improve eduction much before the MOOC revolution. I look forward to reading this book to learn what he has to say about education and learning. </p>
